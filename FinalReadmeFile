WASHERMAN PROBLEM: 2 Washermen wishing to occupy available 1 wash platform

The below described washerman problem describes the problem associated with 
shared resources in real life. 

Here there are two processes in the form of washermen
Washerman 1
Washerman 2

and the shared resource is washing platform required to wash clothes.

Both the washermen wish to occupy the only available platform at the same time
which results in the problem.

This problem can be seen in operating systems as well when there are more
processes requesting shared resource at same time.

To solve this problem, we can use a Semaphore With busy waiting.
Whenever a washerman goes into the washroom to wash clothes, he closes the door
which acts as a notifier to the other washerman. Since, we use busy waiting,
the other washer man keeps on checking the present status of the wash room 
if it is open or closed.

Here,
SEMAPHORE is: WashRoom Door
Shared Resource is: Washing Platform

Hence, we can easily do process synchronization between the two washerman using Semaphores.
